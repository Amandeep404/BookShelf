## App Structure 

**BookShelf** is an Android App build using `Kotlin` and its UI is made using `XML`. The App is using the `MVVM Architecture` so that it is easy to make new changes to the app in the future.
* Splash Screen - For the Splash Screen I have used the new [Splash Screen Api](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/splash-screen) provided by the Android team.
* Api used - I have used [IT Bookstore API](https://api.itbook.store/) for retrieving books data with the data help of `Retrofit` client for parsing `JSON` response.
* Saving data - User can bookmark the books which he/she like or want to buy later. This data is saved in the app's internal storage using the `ROOM library`
so that the user can view the saved books in **Offline-mode**.
* App navigation - I have used `Navigation-components` for easily navigating from one fragment to the other without writting the same boilerplate code again and again.
* Searching - I have implemented the searching of books in the same fragment to challenge my own Self and make the app more user friendly. I have to update the `RecyclerView` according to the search-bar response and show the corresponding result.
